This page is updated periodically with Kimi Open Platform product updates and related documentation changes.
<Update label="September 2026"> ### 🔍 Web Search API Launch web searches through `/v1/tools/search` and `/v1/tools/search_pro` and get structured results — ideal for Agent applications that orchestrate their own search logic.
Organization- and project-level QPS limits are supported.
See [Web Search Basic](/docs/api/tools-search), [Web Search Pro](/docs/api/tools-search-pro), [Web Search Best Practices](/docs/guide/web-search-best-practice), and [Web Search Pricing](/docs/pricing/websearch).
### 💰 Billing method change Account usage is now deducted at a uniform ratio of 50% cash and 50% vouchers.
When either balance is depleted, all subsequent usage is deducted from the remaining balance type.
Users with signed contracts follow their contract terms and continue to prioritize voucher usage — they are not affected.
</Update> <Update label="August 2026"> * The `kimi-k2.5` and all `moonshot-v1` series models (including `-vision-preview` and `moonshot-v1-auto`) were retired across all platforms.
Calls to these models now return a 404 "model not found" error.
Please migrate to [Kimi K3](/docs/guide/kimi-k3-quickstart).
* Files API updates: newly generated file IDs now carry the `file_` prefix; improved parsing of complex content such as tables and formulas; images are no longer OCR'd for text extraction (for image understanding, upload images with `purpose=image`; see [Use Vision Models](/docs/guide/use-kimi-vision-model)); files uploaded with the same name as an existing file are automatically renamed by the server.

At the same time, `kimi-k2.5` and the `moonshot-v1` series are no longer offered to newly registered users; the Global edition added email verification-code sign-up/login and email & Google account binding management.
