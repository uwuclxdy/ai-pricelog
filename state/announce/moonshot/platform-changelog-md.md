# Platform Changelog > Review historical Kimi Open Platform feature releases, model launches, product improvements, and issue fixes.
This page is updated periodically with Kimi Open Platform product updates and related documentation changes.
## August 31, 2026 * The `kimi-k2.5` and all `moonshot-v1` series models (including `-vision-preview` and `moonshot-v1-auto`) were retired across all platforms at 16:00 today.
Calls to these models now return a 404 "model not found" error.
