multimodal vision understanding model DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp is now available on the DeepSeek API platform.
This is an experimental model that can be accessed by setting model='deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp' .
Terminal Bench 2.1: 83.9 NL2Repo: 57.7 DeepSWE: 59.3 DSBench-Hard: 63.6 AutomationBench (Public): 25.7 ApexBench (Pass@1): 36.5 Agents' Last Exam: 27.3 Chartography: 64.3 ZeroBench (Pass@5): 35.0 * For the Code Agent text tasks in the public benchmark sets, the DeepSeek family models were tested using the DeepSeek Harness minimal mode as the framework, with the max effort level, topp=0.95, and temperature=1.0; in the ApexBench and Agents' Last Exam evaluations, the text model DeepSeek-V4-Flash ignores the multimodal elements within them.
In terms of pure-text capabilities (agent, reasoning, world knowledge, etc.), DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp is on par with the official DeepSeek-V4-Flash.
On agent benchmarks that require visual understanding, DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp delivers a significant leap over DeepSeek-V4-Flash, bringing its multimodal agent capabilities close to Opus-4.8.
For usage details, please refer to the Vision guide .

More flexible thinking effort control The thinking modes of V4-Pro and V4-Flash now support three thinking effort levels: low / high / max.
In real-world usage, users can flexibly choose based on task complexity: use low for simple tasks, high for daily Agent tasks, and max for more complex scenarios.
For setup instructions, please refer to the official API documentation: Thinking Mode .
API Pricing Adjustment With the official release of the DeepSeek V4 model family, we will update and adjust API pricing .
To allocate resources more reasonably, we will adopt peak/off-peak pricing, with off-peak prices set at half of the peak-hour prices, encouraging users to schedule their tasks based on actual usage.
The new prices will take effect at 16:00 (UTC Time) on August 16, 2026.
